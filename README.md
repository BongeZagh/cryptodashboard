I created this dashboard to monitor the crypto markets.

* pull candlestick data of all coins traded at binace futures market: 1h, 4h, 8h and 1d.

* detect hormonic patterns if there is any.

* scan for the squeeze TTM breakouts if there is any.

* rank coins based on their rate of returns (1h, 4h, 8h and 24h) and plot bar plots for better and quick grasp of the market.

* the whole repository can be hosted on streamlit as a web APP.
